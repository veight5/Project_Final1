        <h4> <u> KBO: Three former A's players to watch right now with MLB season paused</u> </h4>
            <p> Three former A's players currently are on KBO rosters for the 2020 season. Eric Jokisch and Taylor Motter, both of whom had minor league experience with the A's, also are playing in the KBO. </p>
    
        <h5> Raul Alcantara, RHP, Doosan Bears</h5>
            <p> Alcantara, 27, made his MLB debut with the A's in 2016. He made five starts and had a 7.25 ERA. </p>

        <h5> Aaron Brooks, RHP, Kia Tigers </h5>
            <p>The A's acquired Brooks from the Kansas City Royals in a 2015 trade centered around Ben Zobrist. </p>
            <p> Brooks went 5-7 with a 5.71 ERA over three seasons in Oakland. The A's traded him to the Chicago Cubs in 2016, but then purchased him again in 2018.  </p>
        
        <h5> Dan Straily, RHP, Lotte Giants </h5>
            <p> Straily, now 31, easily is the most-known name on the list. He spent his first three seasons with the A's and has an eight-year MLB career.  </p>
            <p> The veteran right-hander was part of the A's five-player trade with the Cubs in 2014 to acquire Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel.  </p>

         <div id="LINDOR">
             <h4> <u> MLB Rumors: Francisco Lindor Won’t Even Listen To Indians’ Extension Offers </u> </h4>
                <p> The Cleveland Indians shortstop is set to hit free agency following the 2021 season, and it appears like the team he’s spent the entirety of his career with would like to keep him. </p>
                <p> In 143 games last season, Lindor hit .284 with a .854 OPS, mashing 32 homers with 74 RBIs while winning his second career Gold Glove. </p>
                <p> As the market value for All-Star shortstops is on the rise, Fransisco Lindor is betting on himself to out produce the other shortstops in the MLb in hopes he will grab a bag like Mookie Betts did when he moved his talents to LA on a 1yr / $27,000,000 contract this past offseason. And if Lindor can produce, we may see the largest contract to date.. even bigger then Mike Trouts Whopping 12yr / $425,000,000.</p>

        <h3> <u>NBA COVID-19 NEWS</u> </h3>
        <h4 id="NBAQ"> Will There be a 2020 NBA season? </h4>
        <p class="NBAPAPA"> Since the NBA’s decision to suspend the season due to the coronavirus, there are many different scenarios where the league could come back and finish the 2019-20 season. Yet, unless "it's Perfect", like Dallas Maverick's Owner Mark Cuban said the other day on Sports Center, its going to be very hard for teams to get this done. Not only is it a logistical nightmare, but the effect of spreading the disease to more people could be catastrophic.  </p> 
        <p class="NBAPAPA"> One of the larger issues in resuming the 2019-2020 NBA season is the testing factor. While citizens throughout the country are being tested for the disease, the NBA would need an influx of testing as well to make sure their players are healthy and are not spreading it player to player, or player to fan. </p>
        <P class="NBAPAPA"> And with fans and players eager to get back on the court, NBA Commissioner, Adam Silver, has told teams that: "the mian proirity is the health and saftey of our players as well as the fans who attend our games via in person or online. We need to get back on the court as soon as possible, but its very unlikely we will get this done without testing everyone in the building mutiple times that day to make sure we are doing everything we can to reduce the spread of this COVID-19 virus."   </P>
